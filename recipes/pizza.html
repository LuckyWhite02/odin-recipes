    <h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    Pizza is dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.

    One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours—green, white, and red—were those of the Italian flag.

    Italy has many variations of pizza. The Neapolitan pizza, or Naples-style pizza, is made specifically with buffalo mozzarella (produced from the milk of Italian Mediterranean buffalo) or fior di latte (mozzarella produced from the milk of prized Agerolese cows) and with San Marzano tomatoes or pomodorino vesuviano (a variety of grape tomato grown in Naples). Roman pizza often omits tomatoes (an early 16th-century import) and uses onions and olives. The Ligurian pizza resembles the pissaladière of Provence in France, adding anchovies to olives and onions. Pizza has also spread from Italy throughout much of the rest of the world, and, in regions outside of Italy, the toppings used vary with the ingredients available and the flavour profile preferred.


    The popularity of pizza in the United States began with the Italian community in New York City, where the Neapolitan pizza had an early influence. The first pizzeria appeared in New York City about the turn of the 20th century. After World War II the pizza industry boomed. Soon there was scarcely a hamlet without a pizzeria. Sausage, bacon, ground beef, pepperoni, mushrooms, and peppers are traditional toppings familiar to many Americans, but ingredients as varied as arugula, pancetta, and truffles have found their way onto pizzas there. Variations are also often tied to different regions in the country, Chicago’s deep-dish pizza and California-style pizza among them.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <strong>For the base</strong> <br><br>

    <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li><br>

    <strong>For the tomato sauce</strong> <br><br>

    <li>100ml passata</li>
    <li>handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried</li>
    <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li><br>

    <strong>For the topping</strong> <br><br>
    
    <li>125g ball mozzarella, sliced </li>
    <li>handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
    <li>handful of cherry tomatoes, halved </li><br>

    <strong>For finish</strong> <br><br>
    <li>handful of basil leaves (optional)</li>
    <li>a little bit of olive oil</li>


    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <strong>Make the base</strong> <br><br>

        <li>Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</li><br>

        <strong>Make the sauce</strong> <br><br>

        <li>Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li><br>

        <strong>Roll out the dough</strong> <br><br>

        <li>If you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li><br>

        <strong>Top and bake</strong> <br><br>

        <li>Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>
