    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        lasagna is a pasta dish of Italian origin, made with broad often ruffled noodles and a tomato or white sauce.

        Lasagna, in the singular, is a southern Italian variation of what northern Italians call lasagne, in the plural. The name is believed to come from a Latin word for cooking pot, lasanum, though some etymologies trace it to the Greek flatbread called laganon, known in Italy since at least the time of Augustus Caesar (63 bce−14 ce). Lasagna in its modern form, made of a meat sauce much like ragù Bolognese that is layered with noodles and béchamel (besciamella or balsamella) sauce, is believed to have originated in the province of Emilia-Romagna. Variations abound throughout Italy: the lasagna served in Naples, for example, usually contains small meatballs, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, and sliced hard-boiled eggs, while that served in Genoa uses pesto as its sauce. Some recipes use sausage as well as other types of ground meat; others incorporate mushrooms into the ragù.

        American lasagna—the southern term is generally used, since most Italian Americans trace their origins to southern Italy—tends to follow the Neapolitan template, but with many variations. A vegetarian version, for example, will replace meat with spinach and sometimes other vegetables such as peppers and squash. Noodles known in Italy as lasagne verdi are made with spinach as an ingredient.


        Making lasagna is a more labour-intensive process than that required of most other pastas. The lasagna noodles are cooked al dente (firm but not hard) and then drained and cooled, so they can be handled. In an ovenproof dish, a layer of tomato sauce is spooned in and then overlaid lengthwise by a layer of overlapping noodles. To this are added layers of meat sauce, cheese, béchamel, or other ingredients, overlaid by another layer of noodles, and repeated. Italian chefs hold that a lasagna must have a minimum of three layers of noodles, though four layers are more common. The assembled lasagna is then baked at 350 °F (180 °C) for about half an hour. In order to keep the lasagna moist as it cooks, most chefs place a covering of aluminum foil over the dish.


        Lasagna is considered one of the oldest pasta dishes in Italian cuisine, attested to in medieval literature soon after Marco Polo returned from his travels in Asia. Polo himself recounts eating a dish in China that he called lasagne, noting that the flour used for the noodles was from breadfruit.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
         
    
            <li>To make the tomato sauce, heat the olive oil in a saucepan. Add the onions, garlic and carrot. Cook for 5-7 mins over a medium heat until softened. Turn up the heat a little and stir in the tomato purée. Cook for 1 min, pour in the white wine, then cook for 5 mins until this has reduced by two-thirds. Pour over the chopped tomatoes and add the basil leaves. Bring to the boil then simmer for 20 mins. Leave to cool then whizz in a food processor. Will keep, cooled, in the fridge for up to three days or frozen for three months.</li><br>
    
         
    
            <li>To make the white sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan, stir in the plain flour, then cook for 2 mins. Slowly whisk in the milk, then bring to the boil, stirring. Turn down the heat, then cook until the sauce starts to thicken and coats the back of a wooden spoon. Will keep, cooled, in the fridge for up to three days or frozen for three months.</li><br>
    
          
    
            <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Lightly oil two large baking trays and add the peppers and aubergines. Toss with the olive oil, season well, then roast for 25 mins until lightly browned.</li><br>
    
 
            <li>Reduce the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Lightly oil a 30 x 20cm ovenproof dish. Arrange a layer of the vegetables on the bottom, then pour over a third of the tomato sauce. Top with a layer of lasagne sheets, then drizzle over a quarter of the white sauce. Repeat until you have three layers of pasta.</li><br>

            <li>Spoon the remaining white sauce over the pasta, making sure the whole surface is covered, then scatter over the mozzarella and cherry tomatoes. Bake for 45 mins until bubbling and golden.</li><br>
